      <h1>What is a Resistor, Why is it used and How does it work?</h1>
      <img src="foto/12.png" alt="Myblog" title="This photo isn't mine" />
      <h3>What is a resistor?</h3>
      <p>
        A resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow
        of electrical current in an electronic circuit. Resistors can also be
        used to provide a specific voltage for an active device such as a
        transistor.
      </p>
      <p>
        All other factors being equal, in a direct-current (DC) circuit, the
        current through a resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance,
        and directly proportional to the voltage across it. This is the
        well-known Ohm's Law. In alternating-current (AC) circuits, this rule
        also applies as long as the resistor does not contain inductance or
        capacitance.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of resistors</h3>
      <p>Resistors can be fabricated in a variety of ways.</p>
      <p>
        The most common type in electronic devices and systems is the
        carbon-composition resistor. Fine granulated carbon (graphite) is mixed
        with clay and hardened. The resistance depends on the proportion of
        carbon to clay; the higher this ratio, the lower the resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another type of resistor is made from winding Nichrome or similar wire
        on an insulating form. This component, called a wirewound resistor, is
        able to handle higher currents than a carbon-composition resistor of the
        same physical size. However, because the wire is wound into a coil, the
        component acts as an inductors as well as exhibiting resistance. This
        does not affect performance in DC circuits, but can have an adverse
        effect in AC circuits because inductance renders the device sensitive to
        changes in frequency.
